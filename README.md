# Project Title
BlockVerve

# Project Description
BlockVerve is a simple Solidity-based smart contract project that demonstrates basic state management on the Ethereum blockchain. It features a counter that can be incremented, decremented, and queried, serving as a foundational example for decentralized applications.

# Project Vision
To build accessible and scalable blockchain tools that empower developers to create secure, transparent systems for real-world use cases, starting from fundamental smart contract mechanics.

# Key Features
- **Increment Function**: Allows users to increase the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement Function**: Allows users to decrease the counter value by 1, with safeguards to prevent negative values.
- **Get Count Function**: Retrieves the current counter value without modifying state.

# Future Scope
- Integrate access control modifiers (e.g., using Ownable from OpenZeppelin) to restrict function calls.
- Expand to include event emissions for better observability.
- Evolve into a more complex system, such as a voting mechanism or token staking platform.
- Add testing scripts with Hardhat or Foundry for deployment on testnets.
- Contract address: 0x1ccD8891a63d73715972c91C63fE3D40AD89f7F6
